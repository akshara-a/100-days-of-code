# The function def differenceofSum(n, m) accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.

# Assumption:
# n>0 and m>0
# Sum lies between integral range

# Example

# Input
# n:4
# m:20
# Output
# 90

# Explanation

# Sum of numbers divisible by 4 are 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60
# Sum of numbers not divisible by 4 are 1 +2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 150
# Difference 150 â€“ 60 = 90

# Sample Input
# n:3
# m:10
# Sample Output
# 19


def differenceofSum(n, m):
    divSum = 0
    nonDivSum = 0
    for i in range(m+1):
        if i%n == 0:
            divSum += i
        else:
            nonDivSum += i 

    return (nonDivSum-divSum)

n, m = map(int,input().split())
print(differenceofSum(n,m))
